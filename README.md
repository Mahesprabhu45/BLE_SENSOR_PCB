# 🛠 Precision PCB Project

This repository features a PCB that I **designed using KiCad and fully assembled**, including component placement, soldering, routing validation, and hardware testing.  
The project demonstrates an end-to-end real-world PCB development and assembly workflow.

---

### 🔧 What I Did

- Designed the **schematic and PCB layout in KiCad**
- Routed tracks and finalized footprints
- Exported and verified **Gerber files**
- Assembled and soldered all components
- Performed **continuity and functional testing** using a digital multimeter
- Debugged minor soldering errors and improved stability

---

### 🧠 Skills Gained

- PCB design workflow using **KiCad**
- Trace routing, net management & DRC handling
- Soldering and real hardware assembly practice
- Debugging using multimeter and visual inspection
- Understanding PCB tolerances and real-world constraints
